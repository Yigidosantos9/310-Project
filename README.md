=== SPACY NOTES ===

Q1 -Main Purpose: What problem does your app solve?
With the changing world dynamics, there is a serious decrease in the focus time of young people. It is seen that
students, especially at this point, have lost the habit of taking notes during lectures. In order to prevent this, our
application creates new methods of taking notes. We aim to regain these habits that students have lost by making
it more fun and gamifying taking notes during the lesson, where students can encourage each other to study.
Q2 - Target Audience: Who will benefit from using your app?
Although the main target of our project is students from all around the world, it especially includes students who
aim for a high GPA on campus and cannot find a good motivation for daily work. The audience of the application
is generally groups of friends and encourages people to form collective work teams.
Q3 -Key Features: List the main features your app will offer.
The app will offer various features, including collective note collections, Pomodoro-based group work,
common tasks and daily goals, a user-friendly and fun interface, increased efficiency in working with notes,
and other functionalities as needed.
Q4 - Platform: The app will be developed using Flutter for mobile.
The platform is going to be mobile because this app needs to be accessible from every time users need because
they should be free to work at every time they find a leisure time. Also, flutter is used to create an app which is
cross platform in both IOS and Android.
Q5 - Data Storage: What types of data will your app store in the database?
The database will store various types of data, including the working schedule of each user in the groups, team
member information for all users in each group, login information for each user, notes taken by users and
teams, information about note categories, and other relevant data as needed.
Q6 - Unique Selling Point: What makes your app different from existing apps?
The most important differences of our app from others are team management style, combination of task
managing and note sharing among users. Even if there are several apps on focusing on work, note taking or
task management, they are not suitable to form a group and manage of these loads among the group
members.
Q7 - Challenges: What are the potential challenges in developing this app?
Firstly, there will be complex links among pages that we use like note sharing part, group creation or task
manager. So, we need to maintain fluency and data flow among these in a nice way.
Also, as mentioned in previous question the app should be distinctive from others. Therefore, the logic should
be something like a game and attractive. While people are working hard, they should feel happy to do that.
And creation of these fun design in Flutter might be a huge challenge.
